Hey bud,

If you go to 
    
ToodleDone/app/src/main/java/com/wclausen/toodledone/MainActivity.kt

and remove everything related to "toggleFullscreen" that should pretty much do the trick.

I leave it as an exercise to you :) feel free to familiarize yourself with how it works. LMK if you have questions.
